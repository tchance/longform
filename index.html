			<p id="firstlede" class="lede">MOUNT PLEASANT, Mich. -- He was a benchwarmer on his high school basketball team, a decent shooter but not strong or athletic. Even friends say he was easy to push around on the court.
</p>
			<p>A scan through box scores during his senior year at Mount Pleasant High shows he seldom played, and when he did, the score line usually read zeros across.</p>
			
			<p>But Tom Crean was outgoing and popular, voted best dressed in his senior class, according to the school's 1984 yearbook. He had a fondness for Izod polo shirts popular at the time, sometimes with the collar rolled up.</p>

			<p>Beneath the surface, though, he watched as his parents' marriage fell apart and his father became more and more distant. He had a serious health scare as a high school freshman, collapsing in the school cafeteria.</p>

			<div id="event1"></div><p>That Crean became a preeminent college basketball coach -- without being from a basketball family, without being a great student, without money to help carry the dream -- is a testament to a drive and relentlessness that even longtime basketball observers describe as unique.</p>
			
			<p>Where did that drive come from? Crean has talked often about his connection to the Harbaugh family -- especially with his brothers-in-law, Jim and John Harbaugh, coaching against each other in the upcoming Super Bowl â€” but he hasn't talked much about what forged him while growing up in Mount Pleasant, a town of 26,000.</p>

			<p>It is home to Central Michigan University, but the Creans hardly ran with the college crowd after moving there in 1968 from neighboring Harrison, Mich.</p>

			<p>"We didn't have insurance and I still remember his hospital bill," said Crean's father, also named Tom, about his son's birth. "It was $250. Imagine that today."</p>

			<p>The elder Crean moved the family to Mount Pleasant when he got a job as a barber in a state-run home for the mentally ill there. He later worked in patient care.</p>

			<p>Marjorie Crean, Tom's mother, worked a variety of jobs, including as the secretary at a marble company. A sister, Michelle, was born in 1970. The Creans also took in foster children.</p>
