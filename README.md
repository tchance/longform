longform
========
** STILL EARLY IN DEVELOPMENT **

Create a longform template for landscape tablet use. 

This is where I'm falling into the habit of commenting the hell out of my code. I'm quite used to being the only coder. This is meant to eventually be turned into a reusable resource for making embeddable longform stories and to be utilized by others.

End plan is to 

a) separate the CSS and JS into their respective files to keep it clean
b) embed in Adobe DPS
